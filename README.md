Milestone Project 1: Browser Game

# Inspiration: 

For this project I decided to work on a dungeon crawler game similar to the Legend of Zelda. The main reason why I chose this game is because 
it is one of the several games I grew up playing with and the first series of games my mother introduced to me when I was a child. To this day
we sometimes go back and replay the ones we have every so often so I felt it would be great to work on this for this project.

# Concept:

In the game there will be 6 different rooms that the user will be able to navigate, a starting room where the playable character spawns, 2 rooms for the
"win/lose" screens and 3 rooms that will be created through KaboomJS. KaboomJS is a third party library used to be able to create games through Javascript. I chose to utilize this library as a way for me to practice going through the documentation of a third party library and try to implement their aspects into my own code.

# Development Flow: 

For my development flow while I was creating this project, there is not much HTML and CSS use but I have included them in the start page. This project is primarily done
in Javascript.

I am starting with the basic HTML functionality of the start screen. The user will be able to click on the Start button
to open a new page where the game will be handled. 

The next section I tackled is the Javascript portion. Since the level designs will be created to KaboomJS, I believe this would be the next most logical approach.
There will be a small amount of in-line scripting on the start page but the game scripting itself will be done on a seperate .js file.

Finally I will work on CSS to make the start page and the game page more appealing and try to make it accessible to any screen size.

# User Controls:

Once you click the start button on the start page, the user will be able to use the arrow keys to avoid enemies in several levels.

# Unfinished Functionality:

There is quite a bit of unfinished functionality from what I initially planned on for this project. I wanted to include a combat system where the player
could press a button or left/right click to attack enemies and keep track of health and/or score, but due to time constraints I decided to omit this. This also would have
included a few more map designs and several boss fights from different paths that would unlock a path to the final boss of the dungeon.
