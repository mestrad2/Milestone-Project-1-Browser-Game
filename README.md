Milestone Project 1: Browser Game

# Inspiration: 

For this project I decided to work on a dungeon crawler game similar to the Legend of Zelda. The main reason why I chose this game is because 
it is one of the several games I grew up playing with and the first series of games my mother introduced to me when I was a child. To this day
we sometimes go back and replay the ones we have every so often so I felt it would be great to work on this for this project.

# Concept:

In the game there will be 6 different rooms that the user will be able to navigate, a starting room where the playable character spawns, 2 rooms for the
"win/lose" screens and 3 rooms that will be created through KaboomJS. If you get hit by one of the enemies, you lose. If you make it though the 3 rooms
without getting hit, you win.

# Development Flow: 

For my development flow while I was creating this project, there is not much HTML and CSS use but I have included them in the start page. This project is primarily done
in Javascript.

I started with the basic HTML functionality of the start screen. The user will be able to click on the Start button to open a new page where the game will be handled. 

The next section I tackled is the Javascript portion. The level design and game functionality is done through KaboomJS so this was the next logical approach. There is 
a small amount of in-line scripting on the start page but the game scripting itself will be done on a seperate .js file.

Finally I worked on CSS to have a simple start page with a button and background image. 

# User Controls:

Use the arrow keys to move the character.

# Unfinished Functionality:

There is quite a bit of unfinished functionality from what I initially planned on for this project. I wanted to include a combat system where the player
could press a button or left/right click to attack enemies and keep track of health and/or score, but due to time constraints I decided to omit this. This also would have
included a few more map designs and several boss fights from different paths that would unlock a path to the final boss of the dungeon. 

# Bugs:

- Collision detection between some enemies and the 'wall' unit would not work. Workaround used was to add blocks along the walls to work as intended.
