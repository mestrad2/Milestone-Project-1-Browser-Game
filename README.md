Milestone Project 1: Browser Game

For this project I decided to work on a dungeon crawler game similar to the Legend of Zelda. The main reason why I chose this game is because 
it is one of the several games I grew up playing with and the first series of games my mother introduced to me when I was a child. To this day
we sometimes go back and replay the ones we have every so often so I felt it would be great to work on this for this project.

In the game there will be 7 different rooms that the user will be able to navigate, a starting room where the playable character spawns, and 
6 rooms that will be created through KaboomJS. KaboomJS is a third party library used to be able to create games through Javascript. I chose to
utilize this library as a way for me to practice going through the documentation of a third party library and try to implement their aspects into my own code.

As a note for now, this README is still being updated as I work though this project, but I will include the basic functionality of the game that I have in mind.
I will include more specific details as to what the user will be able to do and what to expect as I get closer to completing this project.

-User will be able to control the character and move with the arrow keys
-User will be able to attack with a sword and defend with a shield using key presses or left/right click (TBD)
-User will be able to collect items to unlock the next path in the starting room and ultimately making it to the final room.
